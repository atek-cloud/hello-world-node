# Hello World (NodeJS)

A minimal example app for Atek using the NodeJS runtime.

## How to use

To install this service from github, run:

```
atek install --user {your_atek_username} https://github.com/atek-cloud/hello-world-node
```

If you want to clone it to your FS instead, run this:

```
git clone https://github.com/atek-cloud/hello-world-node
atek install --user {your_atek_username} ./hello-world-node
```

You can then access the app on your host device by its assigned port.
